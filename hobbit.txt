Hobbits are a fictional race of people in the novels of J. R. R. Tolkien.
About half average human height, Tolkien presented hobbits as a variety of humanity,
or close relatives thereof. Occasionally known as halflings in Tolkien's writings, 
they live barefooted, and traditionally dwell in homely underground houses which have windows, built into the sides of hills, though others live in houses. 
Their feet have naturally tough leathery soles (so they do not need shoes) and are covered on top with curly hair.
