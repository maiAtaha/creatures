A dwarf (pl.â€‰dwarfs or dwarves) is a type of supernatural being in Germanic folklore. 
Accounts of dwarfs vary significantly throughout history; however, they are commonly,
but not exclusively, presented as living in mountains or stones and being skilled craftsmen. 
In early literary sources, only males are explicitly referred to as dwarfs. However, they are described as having sisters 
and daughters, while male and female dwarfs feature in later saga literature and folklore. Dwarfs are sometimes described as short; 
however, scholars have noted that this is neither explicit nor relevant to their roles in the earliest sources.
