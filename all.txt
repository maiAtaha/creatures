A creature is a living thing: there are flying creatures, sea creatures, and even imaginary creatures, like unicorns.

Ever heard of a "creature feature"? That's a horror movie about weird scary creatures and 
other monsters. But you can call pretty much any living thing a creature. You'll find all 
kinds of creatures at the zoo, and maybe even a few lurking in your smelly gym shoes. Bears,
bugs, birds, and bunnies are all creatures. When you see the word creature, 
think "It's alive!"
