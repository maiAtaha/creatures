A fairy (also fay, fae, fey, fair folk, or faerie) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature, generally described as anthropomorphic, found in the folklore of multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, and French folklore), a form of spirit, often with metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural qualities.

Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin, but are rather a collection of 
folk beliefs from disparate sources. Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting 
them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, 

as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors to humans, or as spirits of nature.
